            <ul class="work-experience-duties">
              <li>
                Coding skills: Fundamentally, web developers require excellent
                skills in software and coding languages, including HTML, CSS and
                JavaScript. They also require the skills to develop responsive
                designs and to test and debug both the front and back ends of
                websites.
              </li>
              <li>
                SEO skills: A large part of developing a website is ensuring
                it's optimised for ranking highly on search engines. This
                involves creating sites that are mobile-device friendly, load
                quickly and feature easy navigation and clear site maps.
              </li>
              <li>
                Communication skills: Because a freelancer's role largely
                involves finding clients and working with them to create their
                desired results, web developers require excellent communication
                skills. They include keeping a professional manner and tone,
                communicating queries effectively, providing accessible project
                updates and responding quickly and efficiently to questions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Analytical and problem-solving skills: Developing websites
                requires analytical skills in structuring code and identifying
                potential bugs and issues. If they detect any, developers
                require problem-solving skills to identify the most appropriate
                solution and implement it most effectively.
              </li>
              <li>
                Work ethic: Freelancers require an excellent work ethic to focus
                on their business goals, network with potential clients, meet
                client deadlines and build their professional reputations by
                proving themselves reliable and trustworthy and growing loyalty.
              </li>
              <li>
                Business skills: Business skills help web developers create,
                maintain and grow a healthy business. Developers require
                building a professional brand, accounting for business costs,
                doing their own taxes, setting appropriate prices and
                negotiating business deals.
